<h2 class="text-danger">what is Javascript?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.

JavaScript is easy to learn.

This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
</p>
<b class="text-danger">Why Study JavaScript?</b><br><br>
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
<ul>
   <li>1. HTML to define the content of web pages</li>

   <li>2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>

   <li>3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
</ul>
Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
<br>
<b class="text-blue">Did You Know?</b><br>
<p>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</p>

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
<br><br>
You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions.
<br><br>
<b class="w3-text-green">Learning Speed</b><br>
In this tutorial, the learning speed is your choice.

Everything is up to you.

If you are struggling, take a break, or reread the material. <br><br>
<h2 class="text-success">JavaScript Functions and Events</h2>
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for. <br>
<br>
For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button. <br>
<br>
You will learn much more about functions and events in later chapters. <br>
<br>
JavaScript in 'head' or 'body' tag
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
<br><br>
Scripts can be placed in the 'body', or in the 'head' section of an HTML page, or in both.
